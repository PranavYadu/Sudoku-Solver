A modern, user-friendly Sudoku Solver with two modes:
- **Manual Input**: Enter Sudoku puzzles by hand in a beautiful GUI.
- **Image Upload**: Upload a photo of a Sudoku puzzle and let the app recognize and solve it using OCR and computer vision.

## Features
- **Manual Input Mode**
  - Intuitive 9x9 grid for entering puzzles.
  - Number pad and control buttons for easy editing.
  - Highlights conflicts and solved cells.
  - Option to generate a random puzzle.
  - Solve button instantly fills in the solution.
  - **Show Backtracking**: Visualize the solving process step-by-step.

- **Image Upload Mode**
  - Upload a photo or scan of a Sudoku puzzle.
  - Automatic grid detection and digit recognition (using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR).
  - Solves the puzzle and overlays the solution on the image.
  - Option to save the solved image.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- OpenCV (image processing)
- pytesseract (OCR)
- PIL/Pillow (image handling)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) (required for image mode)
- Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pytesseract pillow numpy
```

### Tesseract Setup
- Download and install Tesseract OCR from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
- Update the `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd` path in `image_upload.py` if needed.

## ðŸš€ Clone Repository

To get started with the Sudoku Solver on your local machine, clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PranavYadu/Sudoku-Solver.git
cd sudoku-solver
```

### Running the App

```bash
python main.py
```

- Choose **Manual Input** to enter a puzzle by hand.
- Choose **Image Upload** to solve a puzzle from an image.

## Visualize Backtracking

In manual mode, after solving a Sudoku puzzle, you can click the **Show Backtracking** button to visualize the backtracking algorithm step-by-step. This feature animates how the solver explores possibilities and finds the solution, helping you understand the solving process.

- **How to use:**
  1. Enter your puzzle in manual mode.
  2. Click **Solve** to solve the puzzle.
  3. Click **Show Backtracking** to watch the solving process animated in the GUI.
